Phenomenological means that the macroscopic phenomena are defined in terms of a few quantities that can be observed and measured by macroscopic devices without any reference to microscopic details.\n",
    "- Changes can be induced by the removal of various constraints, such as removing lids, turning on/off the electric field, poking holes in containers, removing thermal insulation, stretching polymers with an applied force, etc\n",
    "- Thermodynamics provides ways of calculating changes of state variables between equilibrium states A and B, which system transitions after removing a constraint.\n",
    "- Furthermore, thermodynamics can predict whether state B can be reached spontaneously or one has to perform work to arrive at state B.\n",
    "- Transformation of states is seen through the changes of thermodynamic variables in thermodynamics space. For instance, change in energy as a function of volume, number of molecules, and temperature.\n",
    "- **Extensive variables** (additive quantities like energy, volume, and number of moles) completely define thermodynamic space. **Intensive variables** (temperature, pressure, magnetic field) can be derived from extensive ones, providing a convenient way of describing the system under constant external conditions. \n",

    "### Extensive vs Intensive variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- In thermodynamics, there are two kinds of variables: **extensive** and **intensive**. The former depends on the size of the system, and the latter is size-independent.\n",
    "- **Extensive variables** are privileged variables that uniquely define the equilibrium states. Examples are $V, N, E, S$. \n",
    "- **Intensive variables** are derived from extensive ones and are considered as conjugate pairs to extensive ones. E.g $V-P$, $N-\\mu$ and $S-T$, are conjugate pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intensive variables do not have the same fundamental status as extensive variables**\n",
    "- Because they do not always uniquely describe the state of matter in equilibrium.\n",
    "- For example, a glass of water with and without an ice cube can be under 1 atm and 0 C, whereas energy and entropy volume values will differ. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note on extensivity** For volume, it may be straightforward to explain why it is extensive. But why is Energy an extensive quantity $E= E_1 + E_2$ for a system with N interacting particles? The additivity of energy can hold if we assume pairwise interactions between particles with interacting potential decaying with distance faster than the $r^{-3}$ in 3D. Meaning that surface interactions become negligible. For instance, if we divide the glass of water into two parts, the total energy, to a good approximation, is a sum of two halves. But notice that if we have microscopic quantities, like handfuls of molecules, this is no longer true\n",

These coordinates have **unique** and well-defined values for each equilibrium state irrespective to how such state was created.  Whether through the violent non-equilibrium process or calm quasi-static sequence of equilibrium states. This is why the functions of extensive variables $E(S,V,N)$ or $S(E,V,N)$ are called **state functions**, and their changes are given by differences between initial or final state only $\\Delta E =E_f -E_i$, $\\Delta S =S_f -S_i$. On the other hand, the work $W$ or heat $Q$ are process dependent, characterizing the way energy is transferred to the system and not characterizing equilibrium states itself.  \n",

The quasistatic path can also be reversible when the path from B to A can be re-traced with zero change in the universe while the system remains in equilibrium. This necessitates the introduction of Entropy, which differentiates reversible from non-reversible changes. \n",
