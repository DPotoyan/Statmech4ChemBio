    "    - **Extensive variables** are privileged variables that uniquely define the equilibrium states. Examples are $V, N, E, S$. \n",
    "    - **Intensive variables** are derived from extensive ones and are considered as conjugate pairs to extensive ones. E.g $V-P$, $N-\\mu$ and $S-T$, are conjugate pairs. \n",

    "- **Intensive variables do not have the same fundamental status as extensive variables**\n",
    "    - Because they do not always uniquely describe the state of matter in equilibrium.\n",

    "- Equilibrium can also be defined as a particular state of matter where a simple macroscopic (as opposed to complex microscopic) thermodynamic description is possible regarding extensive variables. Many of the quantities of interest are ill-defined if the system is not in equilibrium (temperature, pressure, etc). In thermodynamics, we can calculate changes from state A to state B of a system that proceeds via non-equilibrium paths, but it does so by constructing quasi-equilibrium paths ensuring that state A and B are both in equilibrium.\n",

Whether through the violent non-equilibrium process or calm quasi-static sequence of equilibrium states. \n",

    "- **Quasi-static path: a dense succession of equilibrium states** that connects A with B in extensive variables is constructed to compute changes in thermodynamic variables between states A and B. This equilibrium path is quasistatic to ensure the system does not deviate from the equilibrium state during transformation. The quasistatic path can also be reversible when the path from B to A can be re-traced with zero change in the universe while the system remains in equilibrium. This necessitates the introduction of Entropy, which differentiates reversible from non-reversible changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reversible transformations can go in either direction without any change in the environment** Quasistatic paths may correspond to irreversible or reversible transformations! Just because the process is infinitely slow and locally in equilibrium does not make it reversible. For instance, poking a small hole in a container and letting one molecule out very slowly does not make the process reversible. This motivates us to introduce a quantity called entropy, the change of which will tell us whether the process is reversible or not. "
