    "- Thermodynamics is an exact **phenomenological theory** describing changes in material systems in **equilibrium**. Phenomenological means that the macroscopic phenomena are defined in terms of a few quantities that can be observed and measured by macroscopic devices without any reference to microscopic details.\n",
    "- Thermodynamics operates with **Extensive variables** (additive quantities like energy, volume, and number of moles) that completely define **thermodynamic space.**\n",
    "- **Intensive variables** (temperature, pressure, magnetic field) can be derived from extensive ones, providing a convenient way of describing the system under constant external conditions.\n",
    "- Changes can be induced by the **removal of constraints**, such as removing lids, turning on/off the electric field, poking holes in containers, removing thermal insulation, stretching polymers with an applied force, etc\n",
    "- Thermodynamics provides ways of calculating changes of state variables between equilibrium states A and B, which system transitions after removing a constraint. Furthermore, thermodynamics can predict whether state B can be reached spontaneously or one has to perform work to arrive at state B.\n",
    "- Thermodynamics is built upon **fundamental laws**. The **first law** is a statement about the conservation of energy. The **second law** defines the direction of change of a process, that is, whether the process will proceed spontaneously. The second law implies that the thermodynamic space is foliated into adiabats equal to constant entropy.\n",

Yet the underlying principle remains the same as stated in the second law: isolated systems approach equilibrium by increasing entropy, and the final equilibrium state corresponds to a maximum of entropy over variables inducing the change. For non-isolated systems, equilibrium corresponds to the minimization of free energy of the system (or maximization of entropy of a larger system which can be considered isolated)\n",

    "### Extensive vs Intensive variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- In thermodynamics, there are two kinds of variables: **extensive** and **intensive**. The former depends on the size of the system, and the latter is size-independent.\n",
    "    - **Extensive variables** are privileged variables that uniquely define the equilibrium states. Examples are $V, N, E, S$. \n",
    "    - **Intensive variables** are derived from extensive ones and are considered as conjugate pairs to extensive ones. E.g $V-P$, $N-\\mu$ and $S-T$, are conjugate pairs. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Intensive variables do not have the same fundamental status as extensive variables**\n",
    "- Because they do not always uniquely describe the state of matter in equilibrium.\n",
    "- For example, a glass of water with and without an ice cube can be under 1 atm and 0 C, whereas energy and entropy volume values will differ. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Large N ensures the extensivity of Energy** \n",
    "\n",
    "- For volume, it may be straightforward to explain why it is extensive. But why is Energy an extensive quantity $E= E_1 + E_2$ for a system with N interacting particles?\n",
    "- The additivity of energy can hold if we assume pairwise interactions between particles with interacting potential decaying with distance faster than the $r^{-3}$ in 3D. Meaning that surface interactions become negligible. For instance, if we divide the glass of water into two parts, the total energy, to a good approximation, is a sum of two halves. But notice that if we have microscopic quantities, like handfuls of molecules, this is no longer true\n",

    "- Equilibrium can also be defined as a particular state of matter where a simple macroscopic (as opposed to complex microscopic) thermodynamic description is possible regarding extensive variables. Many of the quantities of interest are ill-defined if the system is not in equilibrium (temperature, pressure, etc). In thermodynamics, we can calculate changes from state A to state B of a system that proceeds via non-equilibrium paths, but it does so by constructing quasi-equilibrium paths ensuring that state A and B are both in equilibrium.\n",
    "- The state of Equilibrium is defined relative to **observation time**! A glass of water on the table is in a state of equilibrium on the time scale of minutes but in a state of non-equilibrium over the scale of days because water evaporates, changing the thermodynamic state of the glass.\n",

    "### Fundamental equation of thermodynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fundmanetal equation** in thermodynamics is the equation that binds together all of the extensive variables, e.g., $E(U,V,S,N_1, N_2, ...)$. The state of equilibrium is completely defined by the fundamental equation as a point in the space of thermodynamic coordinates: $E, V, N, S$. These coordinates have **unique** and well-defined values for each equilibrium state irrespective to how such state was created.  Whether through the violent non-equilibrium process or calm quasi-static sequence of equilibrium states. This is why the functions of extensive variables $E(S,V,N)$ or $S(E,V,N)$ are called **state functions**, and their changes are given by differences between initial or final state only $\\Delta E =E_f -E_i$, $\\Delta S =S_f -S_i$. On the other hand, the work $W$ or heat $Q$ are process dependent, characterizing the way energy is transferred to the system and not characterizing equilibrium states itself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transformations between equilibrium states** is the central task of thermodynamics. Knowing the fundamental equation, one can predict the equilibrium state B, which results from equilibrium state A through spontaneous transformation upon removal of a **constraint.**  E.g computing $\\Delta E = E_B - E_A$ given expansion of a box.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quasi-static path: a dense succession of equilibrium states** that connects A with B in extensive variables is constructed to compute changes in thermodynamic variables between states A and B. This equilibrium path is quasistatic to ensure the system does not deviate from the equilibrium state during transformation. The quasistatic path can also be reversible when the path from B to A can be re-traced with zero change in the universe while the system remains in equilibrium. This necessitates the introduction of Entropy, which differentiates reversible from non-reversible changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reversible transformations can go in either direction without any change in the environment** Quasistatic paths may correspond to irreversible or reversible transformations! Just because the process is infinitely slow and locally in equilibrium does not make it reversible. For instance, poking a small hole in a container and letting one molecule out very slowly does not make the process reversible. This motivates us to introduce a quantity called entropy, the change of which will tell us whether the process is reversible or not. \n",
