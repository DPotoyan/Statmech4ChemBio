Python
=======================

The objective of these first few modules is to learn the basics of python and its scientific ecosystem of libraries. With numerical tools of python we will be in a position to easily turn theoretical ideas of statistical mechanics into models and simulations and also be able to leverage the existing computational libraries. 

For obvious reasons our coverage will not be as comprehensive as in the official tutorials [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) reading of which is strongly reccomended for serious study of the language later on. Below you may find a veriety of tutorials with a spefici focus on STEM application.
