    "- The macro-to-micro connection is established using probability arguments with **Entropy** playing the central role (Boltzmann equation)\n",
    "From the thermodynamics point of view, an isolated system with N particles, fixed volume, and Energy is a single macrostate. \n",
    "Such a system, however, would consist of a vast number of microstates. The number can be quantified for some simple systems analytically but is generally intractable even using computers! \n",
    "- In StatMech we replace the dynamics of N particle system with an ensemble of all possible microstates that the system can be consistent with a macrostate (NVE).\n",
    "- Ensemble essentially gives us a probability distribution over microstates, which allows the calculation of Entropy.\n",
    "- Through entropy, all kinds of substance-specific thermodynamic quantities can be computed from the first principles. \n",
    "- E.g., heat capacities, magnetic susceptibilities, free energy differences. These quantities serve as an input for thermodynamics because thermodynamics does not refer to the microscopic world.  \n",
