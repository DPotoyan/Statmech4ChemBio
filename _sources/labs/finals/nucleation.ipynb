    "# Final Project: Metastability and Nucleation in the 2D Ising Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "- In many physical systems, a state can appear *stable* for long times despite being thermodynamically unfavorable. Such states are called **metastable**. One familiar example is supercooled water—it remains liquid below the freezing point until a crystal nucleus forms and initiates freezing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this project, you will explore **metastability and nucleation** using the 2D Ising model. This model—originally developed to describe ferromagnetism—consists of a grid of spins $ s_i = \\pm 1 $, with nearest-neighbor interactions and an external magnetic field $ h $. At temperatures below the critical temperature $ T_c $, the system tends to spontaneously align into one of two magnetized states. But what happens when the system is initially in a “wrong” state, e.g., aligned opposite to the magnetic field?\n",
    "\n",
    "- This setup creates a **metastable state**. It takes a rare fluctuation to nucleate a critical-size droplet of the stable phase, which then grows and flips the entire system. These types of processes are central to **first-order phase transitions**, nucleation in supersaturated vapors, and many biological self-assembly events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will simulate a 2D Ising model *below* the critical temperature, with a small external magnetic field $ h < 0 $, starting from a fully $ +1 $-magnetized state (aligned opposite to the field). Over time, the system will nucleate a region of the $ -1 $ phase, which may grow and flip the entire system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You’ll study:\n",
    "    - How the system escapes the metastable state.\n",
    "    - The statistics of nucleation events.\n",
    "    - The dependence of nucleation time on field strength and temperature.\n",
    "    - The morphology of nucleating droplets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Setup and Simulation**\n",
    "   - Use the 2D Ising model with Metropolis Monte Carlo dynamics.\n",
    "   - Set temperature $ T < T_c $ (e.g., $ T = 2.0 $, since $ T_c \\approx 2.269 $ for the square lattice).\n",
    "   - Add a small external magnetic field $ h < 0 $ (e.g., try $ h = -0.02, -0.05, -0.1 $).\n",
    "   - Initialize the system with all spins set to $ +1 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Observe Nucleation**\n",
    "   - Run the simulation for long times (thousands to millions of MC steps).\n",
    "   - Monitor the magnetization $ M(t) $.\n",
    "   - Plot sample trajectories where a rare nucleation event flips the sign of the magnetization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Measure Nucleation Time**\n",
    "   - Repeat the simulation many times (e.g., 100–500 trials) to get statistics.\n",
    "   - Measure the average time $ \\langle \\tau \\rangle $ it takes for the system to reach negative magnetization.\n",
    "   - Plot $ \\langle \\tau \\rangle $ vs. field strength $ |h| $ (you should observe exponential dependence).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analyze Droplet Formation**\n",
    "   - Record configurations just before the reversal event.\n",
    "   - Visualize and classify droplet shapes.\n",
    "   - Estimate typical droplet size at nucleation.\n",
    "   - Discuss whether they appear compact (circular) or ramified (fractal-like).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Optional Challenge**\n",
    "   - Compare to Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT), which predicts:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\langle \\tau \\rangle \\sim \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta F_c}{k_B T}\\right)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     where $ \\Delta F_c $ is the free energy barrier to form a critical droplet.\n",
    "   - Try estimating $ \\Delta F_c $ from simulation data or using CNT formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Learning Outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, you will:\n",
    "- Understand how **metastability arises** from energy barriers in statistical systems.\n",
    "- Observe and analyze **rare-event dynamics** and **nucleation phenomena**.\n",
    "- Learn techniques for **sampling**, **averaging**, and interpreting **non-equilibrium trajectories**.\n",
    "- Gain insight into how **droplet shape and surface tension** affect the stability of phases.\n",
    "- Appreciate the computational challenge of **long timescales** in simulating rare transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Hints and Suggestions**\n",
    "- Use small system sizes at first (e.g., $ L = 32 $) to speed up dynamics.\n",
    "- Save configurations intermittently to catch droplet formation visually.\n",
    "- Be patient—nucleation is rare! Consider parallelizing or running many short simulations instead of a few long ones.\n",
    "- You might consider implementing early termination when the magnetization crosses zero to save time.\n"
