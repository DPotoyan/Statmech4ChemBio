    "# **Final Project: Simulating Ising Spin Relaxation with Glauber Dynamics**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In real magnetic systems, spins don’t instantly jump between configurations—they **evolve in time**, often driven by thermal fluctuations and local interactions. The **Glauber dynamics** provides a simple and physically motivated way to model how Ising spins flip over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model introduces **stochastic dynamics** where spins flip with a temperature-dependent rate, allowing you to study:\n",
    "- Relaxation to equilibrium from non-equilibrium initial states,\n",
    "- Magnetization dynamics and response functions,\n",
    "- Time-dependent correlation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Metropolis dynamics (which samples from the Boltzmann distribution), Glauber dynamics describes **physical time evolution**, making it perfect for exploring **dynamical aspects** of the Ising model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement **Glauber spin-flip dynamics** for the 1D or 2D Ising model, and investigate:\n",
    "- Relaxation of magnetization from a non-equilibrium initial condition\n",
    "- Correlation functions and dynamical time scales\n",
    "- Temperature dependence of the relaxation time\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Glauber Spin-Flip Dynamics**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a spin $ s_i = \\pm 1 $, the flip probability is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w(s_i \\to -s_i) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(\\beta \\Delta E)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\Delta E $ is the energy change if spin $ s_i $ flips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ \\Delta E = 2 J s_i \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} s_j $\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Pick a random site $ i $\n",
    "2. Compute $ \\Delta E $\n",
    "3. Flip the spin with probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_{\\text{flip}} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{\\beta \\Delta E}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat this $ N $ times per time unit (where $ N $ = number of spins), to define one **Monte Carlo sweep**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Set Up Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a 1D or 2D lattice (start with 2D: $ L \\times L $, e.g., $ L = 32 $)\n",
    "- Start with **fully magnetized state** (e.g., all spins up)\n",
    "- Set parameters: $ J = 1 $, various temperatures $ T = 1.0 \\text{ to } 3.0 $\n",
    "- Simulate Glauber dynamics for many time steps (sweeps)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. nalyze Relaxation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Track total magnetization $ M(t) $\n",
    "- Observe how $ M(t) $ decays toward equilibrium\n",
    "- Fit $ M(t) \\sim e^{-t/\\tau} $ and extract **relaxation time $ \\tau $**\n",
    "- Plot $ \\tau $ as a function of temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Compute Correlation Functions \n",
    "\n",
    "Define the time autocorrelation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C(t) = \\langle s_i(0) s_i(t) \\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a set of spins (or average over all)\n",
    "- Compute how quickly individual spins forget their initial state\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare **Glauber vs. Metropolis** dynamics\n",
    "- Study **critical slowing down** near $ T_c $\n",
    "- Add a small magnetic field and study **relaxation toward field-aligned equilibrium**\n",
    "- Implement **spatial correlation functions** and **structure factors**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the physical meaning of **spin dynamics** and **relaxation**\n",
    "- Connect microscopic rules to **macroscopic observables** (e.g., magnetization decay)\n",
    "- Explore how **temperature influences dynamics**\n",
    "- Practice simulating **stochastic processes** with physically meaningful rates\n",
