    "# Final Project: Simulating Chemical Reactions with Langevin Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scientific Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many chemical and biological reactions involve **crossing energy barriers** due to thermal fluctuations. These processes can be understood as **stochastic dynamics** over a potential energy landscape, where the system hops from one stable state (reactant) to another (product).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll simulate a **1D model reaction** using **Langevin dynamics**:\n",
    "- The particle represents a reactant molecule.\n",
    "- The potential energy landscape represents the **reaction coordinate**, e.g., reactant â†’ transition state â†’ product.\n",
    "- The particleâ€™s crossings of the barrier represent **reaction events**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a numerical experiment in **thermal activation** and a testbed for **rate theory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectiv\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulate a **1D chemical reaction** using Langevin dynamics, estimate the **reaction rate constant** using multiple approaches, and compare your results to **Kramersâ€™ theory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Define the Potential Energy Surface**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a **double-well potential** to represent a reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "V(x) = a(x^2 - 1)^2\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minima at $ x = \\pm 1 $ (reactant and product)\n",
    "- Barrier at $ x = 0 $, height $ \\Delta V = a $\n",
    "- Example: $ a = 2 $ gives $ \\Delta V = 2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "*You can also try asymmetric wells or multi-barrier landscapes later.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Implement Langevin Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the **Langevin equation** for a particle in a potential:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "m \\ddot{x} = -\\gamma \\dot{x} - \\frac{dV}{dx} + \\sqrt{2 \\gamma k_B T} \\, \\eta(t)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\eta(t)$ is Gaussian white noise\n",
    "- Use **BAOAB scheme** (or Euler-Maruyama for simplicity)\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "- Mass $ m = 1 $\n",
    "- Friction $ \\gamma = 1.0 $\n",
    "- Temperature $ T = 0.25 \\text{ to } 1.0 $\n",
    "- Time step $ dt = 0.01 $\n",
    "- Simulate long enough to observe many transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Label States and Count Transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define:\n",
    "  - **Left well**: $ x < 0 $\n",
    "  - **Right well**: $ x > 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "- Count the number of times the particle **switches wells**\n",
    "- Compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "k = \\frac{\\text{Number of transitions}}{\\text{Total time}}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your **empirical rate constant**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Compare to Kramersâ€™ Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Kramers' estimate of the rate constant is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "k_{\\text{Kramers}} = \\frac{\\omega_0 \\omega_b}{2\\pi \\gamma} e^{-\\beta \\Delta V}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\omega_0$: curvature at the well bottom (from second derivative of $ V(x) $)\n",
    "- $\\omega_b$: curvature at the barrier top\n",
    "- $\\Delta V$: barrier height\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare your simulated $ k $ to this analytical expression at various temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Correlation Function Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the population indicator:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "h(x) = \\begin{cases} 1, & x > 0 \\\\ 0, & x < 0 \\end{cases}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the autocorrelation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "C(t) = \\langle h(0) h(t) \\rangle \\sim e^{-kt}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Fit $ C(t) $ to extract the rate constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try **asymmetric double-well**: $V(x) = a(x^2 - 1)^2 + \\delta x$\n",
    "- Compute the **mean first passage time** from one well to the other\n",
    "- Vary **friction** $\\gamma$ to observe **turnover behavior** in Kramers' theory\n",
    "- Simulate in **2D** or on **rugged landscapes**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the **connection between stochastic dynamics and chemical reaction rates**\n",
    "- Explore **rare event sampling** and its challenges\n",
    "- Learn to extract kinetic information from **trajectories**\n",
    "- See how **temperature and friction affect barrier crossing**\n",
