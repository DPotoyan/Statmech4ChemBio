#### Statistical Mechanics for Chemistry and Biology  

**Description:** This website holds content for the course **"Chem 563 Statistical Mechanics for Chemistry and Biology"**  taught during spring semesters at the Deparment of Chemistry at Iowa State University. The course has two major objectives. 
1. Provide graduate students in STEM field with a solid theoretical foundation of statistical mechanics.   
2. Show how to utilize the variety of powerful computational techniques of statistical mechanics such as Monte Carlo, Molecular Dynamics, Stochastic Processes, Machine Learning techniques. 

**Prerequisites:** 

- No programing expreience is assumed. Python3 and its ecosystem of scientific libraries will be introduced at the beginning of the course in an accessible manner.    
- All the examples and applications are primarily inspired from chemistry, materials science and biology problems and as such this course is different in its choice of materials compared to traditional statistical physics courses taught at chemistry departments. 


**On using the notebooks:**

You can read the book on website or download pdf. To get the most out of these notes you should execute code blocks and explore the interactive content in the notebooks. There are several ways to use notebook content:  
- **Open notebooks in the cloud (preferred)**. . Google Collab allows you to save notebooks to GoogleDrive, requires no installations and provides some free GPUs for simulations and machine learning exercises! 
- **Open locally in jupyter notebook/lab (advanced users)** Requires installing anaconda python distribution and all the required packages which can be found on github repository.  

*Comments? Questions?*

For feedback, corrections go to the [Github page](https://github.com/DPotoyan/Statmech4ChemBio/issues) of the course, open an issue and leave your comments, questions and suggestions. I would highly appreciate any feedback and contributions. If you are interested in contributing to the developent of the course please get in touch. I would love to have more people engaged in bettering the course and reaching out to wider scientific and engineering community.
