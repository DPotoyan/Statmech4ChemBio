    "1. **Ferromagnetism**\n",
    "The Ising model is the scalar version of the three-dimensional ‘Heisenberg model’ :\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary alloys and lattice gases**\n",
    "Each lattice site is occupied either by an atom A or B. Nearest neighbour interac- tions are $\\epsilon_{AA}$, $\\epsilon_{BB}$ and $\\epsilon_{AB}$. We identify $A$ with $s_i = 1$ and B with $S_i = −1$. The Hamiltonian then is:\n",
    "$H = − ∑ J_{ij}s_is_j \\langle i,j\\rangle$\n",
    "with $J_{ij} = \\epsilon_{AB} − 0.5(\\epsilon_{AA} + \\epsilon_{BB})$. Thus the Ising model describes order-disorder \n",
    "transitions in regard to composition.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Spin glasses**\n",
    "now each bond is assigned an individual coupling constant J and they are drawn from a random distribution. E.g. one can mix ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic couplings. This is an example for a structurally disordered system, on top of which we can have a thermal order-disorder transition.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conformations in biomolecules**\n",
    "a famous example is the helix-coil transition from biophysics. $s_i$ a hydrogen bond in a DNA-molecules is closed; $s_i$ = −1 the bond is open. The phase tran- sition is between a straight DNA-molecule (helix) and a coiled DNA-molecule. Other examples are the oxygen-binding sites in hemoglobin, chemotactic recep- tors in the receptor fields of bacteria, or the molecules building the bacterial flag- ellum, which undergos a conformational switch if the flagellum is rotated in the other direction (switch from run to tumble phases).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Neural networks representing the brain**\n",
    "$s_i = 1$ a synapse is firing, $s_i = −1$ it is resting. The Hopfield model for neu- ral networks is a dynamic version of the Ising model and Boltzmann machines recognise handwriting by using the Ising model.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Spread of opinions or diseases**\n",
