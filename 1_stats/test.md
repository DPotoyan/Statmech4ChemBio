## Statistical Mechanics* (Chem 5630)

*For chemistry and biology*

---

## Statmech: True or False?

- **Is it just another mechanics subject like classical or quantum?**
- **Is it the application of mathematical statistics to mechanics?**
- **Is it a fundamentally different approach to science?**

---

## Statistical Mechanics: What kind of course is this?

- **Not** about solving exact trajectories  
- **Not** about memorizing formulas  

**Yes to:**

- Thinking in **ensembles**, not single systems  
- Typical behavior vs. rare events  
- Emergent laws from simple rules  
- Approximation as a *feature*, not a bug  

> *Statistical mechanics is the art of asking the right questions when exact answers are impossible — and not needed.*

---

## Levels of Description

- **Microscopic**  
  Positions and velocities of all particles  

- **Mesoscopic**  
  Distributions, correlations, fluctuations  

- **Macroscopic**  
  Pressure, temperature, phases, function  

> **Key question:**  
> What information do we throw away  and why does nothing important seem to be lost?

---

## Why Many-Particle Systems Are Special

- **2 particles** → solvable  
- **~10 particles** → hard, but numerically tractable  
- **\(10^{23}\) particles** → *simple laws emerge*  

> More particles → less predictability microscopically,  
> more predictability macroscopically.

## Why Study Statistical Mechanics?

### Theoretical foundation of complex systems

- How do we describe **many-body systems**?
- Life is inherently unpredictable and complex  
- Probabilistic thinking is the logic of science  
- Statistical physics = science of large numbers

## Equations for Understanding Many-Atom Systems

:::{admonition} Important
You are **not expected** to understand these equations today.
They serve as a roadmap for where we are going.
:::

1. **Entropy** — links thermodynamics and information
   $$
   S = -\sum_i p_i \log p_i, \qquad S = k_B \log W
   $$

2. **Boltzmann distribution**
   $$
   p_i \propto e^{-E_i / k_B T}
   $$

3. **Partition function and free energy**
   $$
   Z = \sum_i e^{-E_i / k_B T}, \qquad F = -k_B T \log Z
   $$

4. **Large deviations & central limit ideas**
   $$
   p_N(z) \sim e^{-N I(z)}, \qquad p_N(z) \sim e^{-z^2}
   $$

5. **Ising model of phase transitions**
   $$
   H = -J s_i s_j + h s_i
   $$
