Python
=======================

:::{admonition} What you need to know
:class: note

- Python code is very intutive and human readable. It allows you to express very powerful ideas in very few lines of code while being very readable. 
- Python is a high-level, dynamically-typed, multiparadigm programming language. 
- What makes python special for STEM fields is its vast ecosystem of scientific libraries (numpy,  pandas, scipy, matplotlib).
- This section will serve as a quick crash course of python programming language and some of its most essential scientific libraries. This module will cover everything we will need for this course.

- Due too time constraints our coverage will be superficial. In addition to the comprehensive official tutorial of python [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) here i will list some links which are best for self-study.
