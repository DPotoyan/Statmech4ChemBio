    "In statistical mechanics, the distribution of particle energies in a system at thermal equilibrium follows the **Boltzmann distribution**. To analyze this, we simulate a system of particles with energies distributed according to:\n",

    "P(E) \\propto e^{-E / k_B T}\n",

    "#### **Tasks:**\n",
    "1. **Generate Energy Data:**\n",
    "   - Simulate **10,000** particle energies following the **Boltzmann distribution** using an **exponential distribution**.\n",

    "2. **Plot Histograms with Different Bin Sizes:**\n",

    "   - Compare how bin size affects the appearance of the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Normalize the Histogram:**\n",
    "   - Convert the histogram into a **probability density function (PDF)** by ensuring the total area under the histogram sums to **1**.\n",
    "   - Use the `density=True` option in `plt.hist()`.\n",
