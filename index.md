### Statistical Mechanics for Chemistry and Biology  

#### Description

- This website holds content for the course **"Chem 563 Statistical Mechanics for Chemistry and Biology"**  taught during spring semesters at the Deparment of Chemistry at Iowa State University.
- The objective of the course is to provide graduate students in STEM field with a solid theoretical foundation of statistical mechanics and showcase its computational utility in wide range of complex problems.   
- The course has a strong computational component and has extensive dsicussion sof Monte Carlo, Molecular Dynamics, Stochastic Processes and Machine Learning techniques. 
- All the code is organized in website as jupyter notebooks and can be run either on Google Colab or locally on a laptop. 

#### Prerequisites

- No programing expreience is assumed. Python3 and its ecosystem of scientific libraries will be introduced at the beginning of the course in an accessible manner.    
- The only prerequisite is basic working knowledge of Calculus and exposure to Thermodynamics taught in most undergraduate chemistry courses.


#### Feedback

- If you find a typo or have a suggestion please open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/DPotoyan/Statmech4ChemBio). I would highly appreciate any feedback and contributions.
