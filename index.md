### Description

* This website hosts the course materials for **“Chem 5630: Statistical Mechanics for Chemistry and Biology,”** taught during the Spring semester in the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University.
* The objective of the course is to provide graduate students in STEM fields with a rigorous theoretical foundation in statistical mechanics while highlighting its computational power for tackling a wide range of complex chemical and biological problems.
* The course places strong emphasis on computation, with extensive discussion of Monte Carlo methods, Molecular Dynamics, stochastic processes, and modern machine learning techniques.
* All course materials are organized as Jupyter notebooks and can be executed either locally on a personal laptop or through Google Colab.

### Prerequisites

* No prior programming experience is assumed. Python 3 and its scientific computing ecosystem are introduced at the beginning of the course in an accessible, hands-on manner.
* The only formal prerequisites are a basic working knowledge of calculus and prior exposure to thermodynamics, as typically covered in undergraduate chemistry curricula.

### Feedback

* If you find a typo or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/DPotoyan/Statmech4ChemBio). Feedback and contributions are very welcome and greatly appreciated.
