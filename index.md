### Chem563: Itroduction to Statistical Mechanics 
This website hosts lectures notes and computational content for the "Statistical Mechanics for Chemistry and Biology" course Chem563 taught at Iowa State University.

You can read the book on website or download pdf. To get the most out of these notes you should execute code blocks and explore the interactive content in the notebooks. There are several ways to use notebook content:  
- **Open notebooks in the cloud (preferred)**. . Google Collab allows you to save notebooks to GoogleDrive, requires no installations and provides some free GPUs for simulations and machine learning exercises! 
- **Open locally in jupyter notebook/lab (advanced users)** Requires installing anaconda python distribution and all the required packages which can be found on github repository.  
  
> [New to jupyter? Then get a qucikstart by watching this youtube tutorial on how to setup and run jupyter notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk)

1. Navigating the notebook

   When you open a notebook, you will find that you can move a highlighted block (with a blue line at the left) with the cursor keys to move up and down. This block highlights a *cell*. (You can also use the mouse to select a cell.) This is called the [Command mode](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html#Command-mode).

2. Executing code

   If you want to execute a cell (for example one that contains some Python code), you can press `Shift+ENTER`. If the cell creates some output, it will be displayed below the cell. (You may not notice if it just updates output that was displayed before, in particular if the new output is the same as the old output.)

3. Editing code

   If you want to *change* the code in the currently highlighted cell, you need to press `ENTER`. You have now entered the [Editing mode](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html#Edit-mode), and the content of the cell can be edited. If you have completed your changes, and you want to execute them, use the `Shift+ENTER` short cut.

   Note that you can also edit blocks of text (or go into edit mode for a text cell unintentionally). Just press `Shift+ENTER` to render the text again, and go back into command mode.

*Comments? Questions?*

For feedback, corrections go to the [Github page](https://github.com/DPotoyan/Statmech4ChemBio/issues) of the course, open an issue and leave your comments, questions and suggestions. I would highly appreciate any feedback and contributions. If you are interested in contributing to the developent of the course please get in touch. I would love to have more people engaged in bettering the course and reaching out to wider scientific and engineering community.
