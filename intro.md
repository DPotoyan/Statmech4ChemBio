This website hosts lectures notes and computational content of the class **Chem563 "Statistical Mechanics for Chemistry and Biology"** hosted at Iowa State. The content of [this course](https://github.com/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/blob/master/Readme.md) is distributed into chapters, using one Jupyter Notebook for each chapter.

You can read the book on website or download pdf. To get the most out of the book however you should open it either (i) an interactive mode by clicking GoogleCollab or MyBinder badges (ii) locally by installing python distribution along with jupyter. In the interactive mode you will get hands on experience with code and examples. If you have not used the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) before, please read the following instructions.

> [Watch this youtube tutorial on how to setup and run jupyter notebooks locally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk)

1. Navigating the notebook

   When you open a notebook, you will find that you can move a highlighted block (with a blue line at the left) with the cursor keys to move up and down. This block highlights a *cell*. (You can also use the mouse to select a cell.) This is called the [Command mode](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html#Command-mode).

2. Executing code

   If you want to execute a cell (for example one that contains some Python code), you can press `Shift+ENTER`. If the cell creates some output, it will be displayed below the cell. (You may not notice if it just updates output that was displayed before, in particular if the new output is the same as the old output.)

3. Editing code

   If you want to *change* the code in the currently highlighted cell, you need to press `ENTER`. You have now entered the [Editing mode](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html#Edit-mode), and the content of the cell can be edited. If you have completed your changes, and you want to execute them, use the `Shift+ENTER` short cut.

   Note that you can also edit blocks of text (or go into edit mode for a text cell unintentionally). Just press `Shift+ENTER` to render the text again, and go back into command mode.

*Comments? Questions?*

For feedback, corrections go to Github page of the course and leave comments there [](). You can also find the most recent versions there.

Enjoy!
