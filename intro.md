### Statistical Mechanics for Chemistry and Biology

This website hosts lectures notes and computational content of the class Chem563 (Spring 2021) at Iowa State etitled "Statistical Mechanics for Chemistry and Biology".
The content of [this course](https://github.com/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/blob/master/Readme.md) is distributed into chapters, using one Jupyter Notebook for each chapter.

You can read the book on website or download pdf. To get the most out of these notes you should execute code blocks and explore the itneractive content inside notebooks. Do it you have two options 
- Open notebooks in the cloud, by clicking either on GoogleCollab or MyBinder badges. Google Collab allows you to save notebooks to GoogleDrive and has a free GPU! 
- Open locally, by installing anaconda python distribution. If you have not used the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) before, please read the following instructions.

1. Navigating the notebook

   When you open a notebook, you will find that you can move a highlighted block (with a blue line at the left) with the cursor keys to move up and down. This block highlights a *cell*. (You can also use the mouse to select a cell.) This is called the [Command mode](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html#Command-mode).

2. Executing code

   If you want to execute a cell (for example one that contains some Python code), you can press `Shift+ENTER`. If the cell creates some output, it will be displayed below the cell. (You may not notice if it just updates output that was displayed before, in particular if the new output is the same as the old output.)

3. Editing code

   If you want to *change* the code in the currently highlighted cell, you need to press `ENTER`. You have now entered the [Editing mode](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html#Edit-mode), and the content of the cell can be edited. If you have completed your changes, and you want to execute them, use the `Shift+ENTER` short cut.

   Note that you can also edit blocks of text (or go into edit mode for a text cell unintentionally). Just press `Shift+ENTER` to render the text again, and go back into command mode.

*Comments? Questions?*

For feedback, corrections go to the [Github page](https://github.com/DPotoyan/Statmech4ChemBio/issues) of the course, open an issue and leave your comments, questions and suggestions. I would highly appreciate any feedback and contributions. If you are interested in contributing to the developent of the course please get in touch. I would love to have more people engaged in bettering the course and reaching out to wider scientific and engineering community.
