After all statistical mechanics is constructed for making a link between probabilistic world of micrrosopic particles and the deterministic world of thermodynamics. Within its domain of applicability (large systems, so called thermodynamic limit) Thermodynamics rules as an undipsuted theory agnostic to molecular realities which has never been defeated by any experiment to date. Statistical mechanical predictions obey the rules of thermodynamics and often thermodynamic arguments (second law, linear scaling of extensive quantities, Gibbs-duhem) is used to validate statistical mechanics claims.
