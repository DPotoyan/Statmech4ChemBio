Boltzman realized that fluctuations around the average $U$ are expected to be very small $O(N^{1/2})$. To find the peak of the distirbution, that is most likely distribution of average energy among members of ensemble ${n_1, n_2, ... n_k}$ given the constant number of particles $N$ average energy $U$.
