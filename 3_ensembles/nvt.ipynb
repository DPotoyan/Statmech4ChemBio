    "### Problem-4 Elementary derivation of Boltzmann's distirbution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us do an elementary derivation of Boltzman distribution showing that when a macroscopic system is in equilibrium and coupled to a heat bath at temperatere $T$ we have a universal dependence of probability for finding system at different energies: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boxed{P(r')/P(r)=e^{-\\beta (U(r)-U(r'))}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of the derivation is this. Consider a vertical column of gas somehre in the mountains.\n",
    "- On one hand we have graviational force which acts on a column between $h, h+dh$ with cross section $A$. \n",
    "- On the other hand we have pressure balance which thankfully keeps the molecules from dropping on the ground. \n",
    "- This means that we have a steady density of molecules at each distance $n(h)$ for a fixed $T$. Write down this balance of forces (gravitational vs pressure ) and find show how density at $h$, $n(h)$ is related to density at $h=0$, $n(0)$. \n",

    "### Problem-5 2D diploes on a lattice\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a 2D square lattice with $M$ lattice points. On each point we have a mangeetic moment that can point in four possible directions: $+x, -x, +y, -y$. Along $y$ axis, the dipole has the energy $\\epsilon>0$ and along the x axis $\\epsilon=0$.\n",

    "Dipoles are not interacting with each other and we also ingnore kinetic energy of diplos since they are fixed at lattice positions. \n",

    "- Compute the average energy.\n",

    "### Problem-6 A typical spin problem \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to a ligand field, the degeneracy of d-orbital of chromium ion $Cr^{3+}$ is partially lifted. The spin part of the hamiltonian that lifts this degeneracy has the following form.\n",

    "$$H =  D \\big(S_z^2 -S(S+1)/2 \\big)$$\n",

    "Where $D>0$ is some constant and $S=3/2$ (the cation has an electronic term ${F}^ 4_{3/2}$\n",

    "- Conceptual question: Why can we apply statisical mechanics to a \"single\" ion?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Obtain the occupation probability of each discrete energy level $P(E)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate the entropy and the specific heat then show that heat capacity behaves as $T^{-2}$ at high temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supose heat capacity is $C=k_b \\Big(\\frac{T}{T_0} \\Big)^2$ with $T_0=0.18 K$ at higher temperatures. Determine the energy spacing. "
