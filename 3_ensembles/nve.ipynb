    "- Understand that essence of equilirbium statistical mechanics is in connecting **thermodynamics** operatig at macroscopic scales with the **microscopic states** of atoms and molecules. \n",
    "- The macro to micro connection is established using probability arguments with **Entropy** playing the central role (Boltzmann equation)\n",
    "- An isolated system with N particles with fixed volume and Energy is a single macrostates from thermodynamics point of view. \n",
    "- Such a system, however, be in vast number of microstates. The number can be quanitfied for some simple systems analytically but is generally intractable even using computers! \n",
    "- In StatMech we replace the dynamics of N particle system with an ensemble of all possible microstates that the system can be consistent with a macrostate (NVE).\n",
    "- Ensemble essentially is giving us a probability distirbution over microstates which allows allows calculattion of Entropy.\n",
    "- Through entropy all kinds of substance specific thermodynamic quantities can be computed from the first principles. \n",
    "    - E.g heat capcities, magnetic susceptiiilties, free energy differences. These quanties serve as an input for thermodynamics becasue thermodynamics makes no refernce to microscopic world.  \n",
    "- Thermodynamics while agnostic to atomic details is an exact theory. Predictions of statistical mechanicss must obey the rules of thermodynamics."
